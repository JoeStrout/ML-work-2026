# Configuration for baseline mitochondria segmentation (no pre-training)

# Model - no pretrained checkpoint for baseline
resume_checkpoint: null

# Data
patch_size: 128           # Size of training patches
train_samples: 5000       # Number of training samples per epoch
val_samples: 500          # Number of validation samples per epoch

# Training
bs: 32                    # Batch size
epochs: 1001              # Number of training epochs (2x LeJEPA version for fair comparison)
lr: 0.001                 # Learning rate

# Loss
# Class weights for BCE loss (computed as inverse frequency)
# Mitochondria ~7.78%, background ~92.22%
# weights: [1.0, 11.86] for [background, mitochondria]
pos_weight: 11.86         # Weight for positive class (mitochondria)

# Evaluation
eval_every: 5             # Evaluate every N epochs
save_every: 50            # Save checkpoint every N epochs
visualize_every: 50       # Save visualization every N epochs
